# Cloud Team Copilot Agents

A VSCode extension that provides centralized custom GitHub Copilot agents for cloud engineering teams. This extension enables teams to share consistent AI-powered assistants across all team members with automatic updates from a central repository.

## Features

- **Centralized Agent Management**: All agents are defined in a central Git repository
- **Automatic Updates**: Agents automatically sync from the master branch every 5 minutes
- **Persistent Across Workspaces**: Once installed, agents are available in all VSCode workspaces
- **URL Resource Integration**: Agents can ingest external resources (URLs, APIs) as context
- **Team-Specific Agents**: Pre-configured agents for common cloud engineering tasks

## Initial Agents

### 1. Agile Agent (`@cloudteam.agile`)
Helps write epics and user stories following agile best practices
- Formats stories using the "As a... I want... So that..." template
- Includes acceptance criteria
- Follows INVEST principles

### 2. AWS Service Evaluation Agent (`@cloudteam.aws-evaluation`)
Assists in evaluating AWS services for your architecture
- Analyzes service capabilities and limitations

- Evaluates security and compliance
- Provides integration recommendations

### 3. Documentation Agent (`@cloudteam.documentation`)
Ensures consistent, high-quality technical documentation
- API documentation
- User guides
- Architecture documents
- README files
- Runbooks and SOPs

### 4. OKR Agent (`@cloudteam.okr`)
Generates objectives and key results for performance reviews
- Creates measurable OKRs
- Aligns with team goals

- Tracks progress and achievements

## Installation

### Method 1: Install from VSIX file (Recommended for Teams)
1. Download the `.vsix` file from your team's distribution channel
2. Open VSCode
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
4. Type "Install from VSIX" and select "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
5. Select the downloaded `.vsix` file
6. Restart VSCode

### Method 2: Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd system-prompts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the extension
npm run compile

# Package the extension
npm run package

# This creates a .vsix file that can be distributed to your team
```

## Configuration

### Setting up the Central Repository

1. Open VSCode settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "Cloud Team Copilot Agents"
3. Set the repository URL:
   - `cloudTeamCopilotAgents.repositoryUrl`: Your Git repository URL
   - `cloudTeamCopilotAgents.branch`: Branch to sync from (default: master)
   - `cloudTeamCopilotAgents.updateInterval`: Update interval in ms (default: 300000)

Or use the command palette:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run "Cloud Team Agents: Configure Repository"
3. Enter your repository URL

## Repository Structure

Your central repository should have the following structure:

```
your-repo/
├── agents.json           # Main configuration file
├── agents/              # Optional: Individual agent prompt files
│   ├── agile.md
│   ├── aws-evaluation.md
│   └── documentation.md
└── templates/           # Optional: Template files
    ├── epic-template.md
    └── api-doc-template.md
```

### agents.json Format

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "name": "Agent Name",
      "description": "What this agent does",
      "prompt": "System prompt for the agent or file:agentfile.md",
      "resources": [
        {
          "type": "url",
          "url": "https://example.com/resource",
          "cacheDuration": 3600000
        }
      ],
      "examples": ["Example 1", "Example 2"],
      "templates": ["Template 1", "file:template.md"],
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

### Using Agents in Copilot Chat

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VSCode
2. Type `@cloudteam` to see available agents
3. Select an agent (e.g., `@cloudteam.agile`)
4. Type your request

Example:
```
@cloudteam.agile Help me write a user story for implementing a password reset feature
```

### Commands

- **Cloud Team Agents: Refresh Agents** - Manually sync agents from repository
- **Cloud Team Agents: Configure Repository** - Set up repository URL
- **Cloud Team Agents: Show Agent Status** - View loaded agents

## Adding New Agents

To add a new agent to your team:

1. Edit `agents.json` in your central repository
2. Add a new agent entry with:
   - Unique `id`
   - Descriptive `name` and `description`
   - System `prompt` (inline or reference to file)
   - Optional `resources`, `examples`, and `templates`
3. Commit and push to master
4. All team members will receive the update within 5 minutes (or manually refresh)

## Security Considerations

- Repository access: Ensure your central repository has appropriate access controls
- Resource URLs: Only include trusted URLs in agent resources
- Sensitive data: Do not include secrets or sensitive information in prompts or templates
- Network access: The extension requires network access to sync agents and load resources

## Troubleshooting

### Agents not appearing
1. Check that the repository URL is correctly configured
2. Ensure you have network access to the repository
3. Run "Cloud Team Agents: Show Agent Status" to check loaded agents
4. Check the Output panel (View > Output) and select "Cloud Team Copilot Agents" for logs

### Sync failures
1. Verify the repository URL and branch name
2. Ensure `agents.json` exists in the repository root
3. Validate JSON syntax in `agents.json`
4. Check network connectivity and proxy settings

### Resource loading issues
1. Verify resource URLs are accessible
2. Check for CORS issues if loading web resources
3. Review cache settings for resources

## Development

### Building the Extension

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Watch for changes
npm run watch

# Package as VSIX
npm run package
```

### Testing Locally

1. Open the project in VSCode
2. Press `F5` to launch a new VSCode window with the extension loaded
3. Configure the repository URL in the new window
4. Test agent functionality
