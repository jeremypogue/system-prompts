# ✅ Extension Installed - Next Steps Required

## Why Agents Aren't Showing Yet

The extension was installed but needed configuration to know where to find the agents. I've just configured it to use your local repository.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

### 1. Restart VSCode (REQUIRED)
   - Close VSCode completely
   - Re-open VSCode
   - This allows the extension to reload with the new configuration

### 2. Verify Extension is Working
   After restarting VSCode:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Type: `Cloud Team Agents: Show Agent Status`
   - Press Enter
   - You should see a message showing 4 agents loaded

### 3. Access Your Agents
   - Open GitHub Copilot Chat (click the chat icon in sidebar or press `Ctrl+I`)
   - Type `@` in the chat
   - You should now see:
     - `@cloudteam.agile` - Agile/Scrum agent
     - `@cloudteam.aws-evaluation` - AWS service evaluation
     - `@cloudteam.documentation` - Documentation standards
     - `@cloudteam.okr` - OKR/performance reviews

### 4. Test an Agent
   Try this in Copilot Chat:
   ```
   @cloudteam.agile Help me write a user story for adding SSO login
   ```

## What We Just Configured

The extension is now configured to:
- Load agents from: `C:/Users/jeremypogue/Documents/repo/system-prompts`
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
- Use the `agents.json` file in this directory

## For Your Team

Once you confirm it's working:

1. **Push this repository to GitHub/GitLab**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial cloud team copilot agents"
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   git push -u origin master
   ```

2. **Update the configuration** to use the remote repository:
   - Go to VSCode Settings (`Ctrl+,`)
   - Search for "cloudTeamCopilotAgents.repositoryUrl"
   - Change from `file:///...` to your GitHub URL

3. **Distribute to team**:
   - Share the `cloud-team-copilot-agents-1.0.0.vsix` file
   - Share the repository URL
   - Each team member configures the same repository URL

## Troubleshooting If Agents Still Don't Appear

1. **Check Extension Status**:
   - Go to Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
   - Search "Cloud Team Copilot"
   - Make sure it's enabled

2. **Check Output Logs**:
   - View → Output
   - Select "Cloud Team Copilot Agents" from dropdown
   - Look for any errors

3. **Manual Refresh**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Run: `Cloud Team Agents: Refresh Agents`

4. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Open Settings (`Ctrl+,`)
   - Search: `cloudTeamCopilotAgents`
   - Ensure repository URL is set correctly

## Files Created for You

- ✅ **Extension Package**: `cloud-team-copilot-agents-1.0.0.vsix`
- ✅ **Agent Definitions**: `agents.json` (4 agents ready)
- ✅ **Documentation**: `README.md`, `SETUP_GUIDE.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- ✅ **Source Code**: Complete TypeScript implementation in `src/`
- ✅ **Quick Setup**: `quick-setup.ps1` (already run)

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. `@cloudteam` agents appear in Copilot Chat
2. "Show Agent Status" command shows 4 agents
3. Agents respond with their specialized knowledge
